  A basic SimpleStorage contract, implemented with React Context and Hook to wrap injected Torus key pair to sign transactions on web app
</h1>

[tor.us](https://docs.tor.us/) - bills itself as "authentication abstracted for the decentralized ecosystem". Give your users a smooth familiar onboarding experience by letting them sign up with google email accounts and other familiar OAuth providers.

Built and designed to be trustless, usersâ€™ identities are not controlled by any central authority, which means that your user owns the keys.

[tor.us documentation](https://docs.tor.us/)

This boilerplate allows you to get tor.us up and running with Gatsby. Please follow the recorded guide to spin this application up. Note that while we employ Gatsby for its merits on static site generation, the majority of the important code (Torus, React Context + Hook) can be ripped out and used in any framework or even in vanilla ReactJS.
